I removed some of the unneccessary bloat, and made it easier to alter the format of the entire page if things are intended to stay uniform. I left the alternate classes in the css page as comments so one can easily alter certain format aspects if they so wish. added comments to clarify the use of certain areas and to attempt to maintain an idea of where and what you are altering. may need to clean up the commented code to provide a easier level of distinction. may also need to rewrite some of the code from groundup as it appears their are some unneccessary elements in some sections. condensed code down to 6 style sections for the bulk of the pages formatting.
need to still make accessibility updates to the page, and trying to make the right side of the page even in height with the rest of the pages formatting it hangs low slightly, looks weird.
